                                    Hello everyone! Welcome to my website! I'm about to describe to you who I am, let's get started!
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    So, I am currently 16 years old. I'm a french student (currently in last year of high school).
                                    My favourite animals are llamas and cats! They're very cute, just like my boyfriend ðŸ’•
                                    Anyways, I discovered programming when I was 9 in a club in the school I was in.
                                    Then I started doing some in my free time, on my own when I was 10 or 11. Since that moment,
                                    i've trained a lot and gathered some experience, started open-source projects, did stuff for the
                                    community and overall achieved to do some cool stuff (mainly discord bots related unfortunately)
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    So let's tell you about what I learnt during these years. When I was 9 i learnt stuff about python.
                                    But then, by playing some Minecraft around the age of 10, I discovered Java and did some plugins
                                    for Minecraft servers (mostly moderation-related, maybe 1 or 2 mini-games).
                                    I also practiced web development (basically static websites). When I was 13 I discovered
                                    the Node.JS magic and fell in love for it. So now I'd say I became really good at JavaScript.
                                    <br/>
                                    I have then discovered TypeScript and little did I know I could love something that much!
                                    I've done a lot of discord bot related stuff (music bot, image-manipulation api, multipurpose bot, modules, ...).
                                    One other thing is I love helping people out with development and I make almost every project I do open-source and
                                    love contributing to some of my friends' repos. Lately, I've been learning other languages such as GoLang, Rust, C++,
                                    Python, and also some frameworks like Fyne, Vue and React.
                                    <br/><br/>
