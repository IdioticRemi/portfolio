                            First of all, <b>I LOVE YOUR CONTENT</b>. It has helped me grow a lot
                            when I was learning JavaScript and understanding new programming concepts.
                            What I really liked at first was your approach to teaching random people
                            what looked complicated but was not thanks to your explanations.
